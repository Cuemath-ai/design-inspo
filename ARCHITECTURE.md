# Inspo — architecture & setup reference

A shared inspiration library for the Cuemath design team. People drop links or
images in a Slack channel with one line about what caught their eye; the system
tags them, screenshots them, and publishes a searchable visual gallery.

**Gallery:** https://cuemath-ai.github.io/design-inspo/
**Repo:** `Cuemath-ai/design-inspo` (public)
**Local path:** `~/design-inspo` (deliberately NOT inside `~/Desktop` — see §4)
**Slack channel:** `#design-inspo` — id `C0BA05V4C7M` (workspace: cuemath)

> No secrets live in this repo. Tokens are in gitignored local files and in
> Cloudflare. This doc only says *where* they are.

## 1. The loop (how it all fits)

```
Someone posts in #design-inspo  ──┐
                                   │  (link/image + one line)

        ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐

        └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Three independent pieces: an always-on **Worker** (instant feedback + Monday
digest backstop), a **scheduled sweep** on Manik's Mac (the heavy AI work), and
a **static gallery** on GitHub Pages. Nothing needs paid API keys.

---

## 2. Slack app ("Inspo" bot)

Configured at api.slack.com/apps → **Inspo**. Bot user id `U0BAFCRH79S`.

**Bot token scopes** (all required):
- `chat:write` — post nudges / confirmations / digest
- `reactions:write` — ✅ confirm edit commands
- `channels:history` — read the channel + receive message events
- `files:read` — download uploaded images/videos
- `users:read` — resolve who posted (author names)

**Event Subscriptions:** enabled, Request URL = the Worker URL (below),
subscribed to the bot event **`message.channels`**. This is what makes the
instant nudge fire.

**Secrets:** the Bot User OAuth token (`xoxb-…`) and the Signing Secret live
in two places only — gitignored local files (§6) and Cloudflare Worker secrets
(§3). If a token is ever rotated, update **both** places.

---

## 3. Cloudflare Worker (`inspo-nudge`)

Code: `worker/src/index.js`. Config: `worker/wrangler.toml`.
**URL:** https://inspo-nudge.manik-bansal.workers.dev

Two jobs:
1. **`fetch()` — instant nudge.** Slack pings it on every post. If a message has
   a link or file but no real description, the bot replies in-thread within a
   second ("Ooh, nice find! 🐼 …"). It verifies Slack's signature (HMAC, replay
   window 5 min), ignores bot messages / thread replies / plain chatter.
2. **`scheduled()` — Monday digest backstop.** Cron `30 11 * * 1` (UTC) = **5 PM
   IST Monday**. Posts a template Po digest **only if** the Mac sweep hasn't
   already (it checks the channel for a 🧲 in the last ~10h). Reads the live
   `index.json` to count the week's adds.

It also serves the **gallery "like" API** (added 2026-06-13):
- `GET /loves` → `{ entryId: count }` for the whole library (gallery likes only).
- `POST /love` `{id, delta:+1|-1}` → toggles one like, returns the new count.
- Both send CORS headers for the Pages origin. Counts persist in a free
  Cloudflare **KV** store (binding `LOVES`, a single key `counts` holding the
  JSON map). Not transactional — fine for an internal team's like counts.

**Worker secrets** (set via `wrangler secret put`, never in git):
`SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`.
**Worker var:** `INSPO_CHANNEL = C0BA05V4C7M`. **KV binding:** `LOVES` (both in wrangler.toml).

**Deploy / operate** (from `worker/`):
```
npx wrangler deploy          # publish changes
npx wrangler tail            # live logs
npx wrangler secret put SLACK_BOT_TOKEN      # (re)set a secret
npx wrangler dev --test-scheduled --port 8799   # test the digest locally,
  # then: curl "http://localhost:8799/__scheduled?cron=30+11+*+*+1"
```
Local testing reads secrets from `worker/.dev.vars` (gitignored).

---

## 4. The sweep (launchd background job on Manik's Mac)

Runs via **macOS launchd**, the same way Design Daily does — NOT the in-app
scheduler (that one is disabled). This means it runs **unattended in the
background: no Claude app open, no permission prompts.**

- **LaunchAgent:** `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.manikbansal.inspo-sweep.plist`
  → runs `/bin/bash <repo>/.curator/run.sh` at **12:07 and 20:07** local.
- **`.curator/run.sh`** (gitignored — machine-specific) sets PATH/HOME, then runs
  the headless Claude CLI: `claude -p "$(cat .curator/prompt.md)"
  --dangerously-skip-permissions --output-format text`. That flag = "trusted
  automation in this folder, don't stop to ask" — so it never prompts. It uses
  Manik's normal Claude login (no API key, no extra cost). Logs to `.curator/run.log`.
- **`.curator/prompt.md`** tells it to follow `SWEEP.md`.
- Manage it: `launchctl unload/load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.manikbansal.inspo-sweep.plist`.
  Re-create the runner/plist on a new machine (they're gitignored) — see this section.
- **⚠️ Location matters:** the repo must live OUTSIDE macOS's protected folders
  (`~/Desktop`, `~/Documents`, `~/Downloads`). launchd can't run scripts there →
  "Operation not permitted". That's why it sits at `~/design-inspo`, like Design
  Daily. If you ever move it, keep it in the home root.

Still needs the **Mac powered on** at the scheduled time (launchd runs missed
jobs on next wake). The Worker handles time-sensitive nudges 24/7, so the only
effect of the Mac being off is the gallery refreshing later. The sweep is
idempotent — `state.json.last_swept_at` means a late run catches up on everything.

**What a run does** (see `SWEEP.md` for the exact steps): pull, read new channel
messages, for each new post → screenshot (or download an upload), choose tags,
write the entry JSON, confirm in-thread as Po; refresh love counts; rebuild
`index.json`; push. On Mondays 10:00–16:59 it also posts the fresh Po digest
(marked 🧲 so the 5 PM Worker backstop stands down).

### Why the sweep is built the way it is (IMPORTANT for edits)

The launchd runner uses `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, so prompts aren't an
issue today. But the sweep is still built from clean, pre-approved, absolute-path
`node` scripts (no raw `git`/`cd`/`grep`) — it keeps the design tidy and means it
also runs prompt-free under the in-app scheduler if that's ever used as a
fallback. (Background: Claude refuses to auto-approve `cd … && …` compound
commands, so the scripts avoid them.) The design:

- **Every action is a pre-approved, absolute-path `node` script.** No raw `git`,
  no `cd`, no `grep`/`cat`/`ls`/`sed`. To read a file the run uses the Read
  tool, not `cat`.
- That's why `scripts/git-sync.mjs` exists — it runs git via `git -C <repo>` so
  the sweep never has to `cd`.
- All scripts resolve their own paths (via `import.meta.url`), so they work from
  any working directory.
- The allow-list + allowed-directory live in `.claude/settings.local.json`
  (gitignored, §6). If you add a NEW command to the sweep, add its absolute-path
  pattern there or it will prompt.

If a future run starts prompting again, the cause is almost always: a command
that isn't in the allow-list, a relative path instead of absolute, or a `cd`
slipping in. Fix the script/SWEEP.md to use the approved absolute-path form.

## 5. The gallery (GitHub Pages)

Static, no framework. Served from the repo root of `main`.

- `index.html` / `styles.css` / `app.js` — the gallery (dark masonry, floating
  search, tag chips, Recent↔Loved sort, full-screen detail view with motion
  playback, filled "Visit site" button, Back, keep-browsing grid below detail).
- `search.js` — vibe-search matching (`entryHaystack`, `expandQuery`,
  `scoreEntry`); unit-tested.
- `synonyms.json` — the synonym map that makes "moody"/"playful" etc. match
  related tags. Extend this to improve search.
- **Thumbnails:** a shared image is the card as-is; a shared video becomes the
  motion clip AND a frame of it is the still; a link-only post gets the best
  screenshot the sweep can take (`scripts/shot.mjs` — clean hero by default,
  `--find "<text>"`/`--scroll` to capture the part the description names, `--full`
  for whole-page, `--motion` for a clip; it also dismisses cookie pop-ups).
- **Likes:** each card and the detail view have a heart. Clicking it calls the
  Worker's `/love` endpoint (§3) and toggles your like. The displayed love count
  = Slack reactions (from `index.json`, synced by the sweep) **plus** gallery
  likes (live from the Worker). "Sort by Loved" uses that sum. One like per
  browser (tracked in `localStorage` key `inspo-liked`). On touch devices the
  card heart only appears in the detail view (cards reveal it on hover).
- `bundle.css` — CueDesign design system (tokens + embedded Athletics / Untitled
  Sans fonts via `@font-face local()`). Copied from Cuemath-Hive. On machines
  without those fonts it falls back per the design system's own stack.

GitHub Pages has a CDN cache, so a push can take a couple of minutes (and a
hard refresh) to appear live.

## 7. Common tasks

- **Change sweep frequency:** edit `StartCalendarInterval` in
  `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.manikbansal.inspo-sweep.plist` (currently 12:07 &
  20:07), then `launchctl unload` + `launchctl load -w` it. Keep one slot inside
  Mon 10:00–16:59 so the Mac posts the fresh digest before the 5 PM Worker backstop.
- **Change the digest day/time:** Mac side = the window in `SWEEP.md` §7; cloud
  backstop = the cron in `worker/wrangler.toml` (UTC) — redeploy after editing.
- **Improve search:** add clusters to `synonyms.json` (lowercase, list each
  cluster once; expansion is bidirectional).
- **Rotate the bot token:** regenerate in the Slack app, then update BOTH
  `.slack-bot-token` (local) and the Worker secret (`wrangler secret put
  SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`).
- **Tidy the bot's own channel messages:** `node scripts/clean-bot-messages.mjs`.
- **Edit an entry from Slack:** reply on its thread in plain language — "add
  the tag dark", "change the description to…", "update the link to…", "make this
  its own entry", "remove this". The sweep reads the intent (no rigid syntax;
  the old `retag:`/`edit:`/`remove` prefixes still work). Ambiguous replies get
  a Po-voiced clarifying question instead of a guess; applied changes get a
  Po-voiced confirmation. Removal uses `scripts/remove-entry.mjs <id>`.
- **Run the sweep manually:** `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.manikbansal.inspo-sweep`
  (or `bash ~/design-inspo/.curator/run.sh`). Watch `.curator/run.log`.

---

## 8. Known gotchas

- **Rebuild AND commit `index.json`.** It's a build artifact; `data/entries/`
  is the source of truth. If you delete/add entries by hand, run
  `node scripts/build-index.mjs` and commit the result — otherwise the gallery
  shows stale/broken cards. (This bit us once: deleted entries lingered because
  the rebuilt index wasn't staged.)
- **Pages cache lag:** a push takes ~1–3 min and a hard refresh to go live.
- **GitHub 100 MB/file cap:** motion clips are short (~6s) and compressed; long
  screen recordings won't fit. `.mov` uploads are converted to web `.mp4` with
  ffmpeg.
- **Public repo = public content.** The pinned channel rule says "nothing
  internal/confidential."
- **Sweep depends on the Mac being on** (see §4). Cloud-hosting the heavy sweep
  would need a paid AI key (deliberately not done).
- **Never put the repo in `~/Desktop`/`~/Documents`/`~/Downloads`** — launchd can't
  run scripts in those macOS-protected folders ("Operation not permitted"). Home root only.
- **Permission prompts returning** → see §4's "why it's built this way": a new
  command needs an absolute-path allow-list entry; never introduce `cd`/raw git.

## 9. History

Built 2026-06. Designed around three constraints: no paid API keys for the core
loop, frictionless capture (just post in Slack), and a genuinely nice browsing
experience for designers. The bot's personality is Po from Kung Fu Panda.

**Changes since launch:** gallery likes (Worker + KV); plain-language thread
edits with Po-voiced confirmations; smarter thumbnails (shared media wins,
link shots match the description); the sweep moved from the in-app scheduler to a
**launchd** background job and the repo relocated from `~/Desktop` to
`~/design-inspo` (2026-06-18) so macOS folder protection doesn't block it.
